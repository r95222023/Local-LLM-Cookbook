    "LANGGRAPH ReAct Agent is designed for robust reasoning and tool-calling functionality. Instead of using a single prompt to generate thought, action, and observation simultaneously, this new method divides the process into different steps plus a reflection step to improve the final result, each controlled by different prompts. This approach provides more flexibility and robustness. If an error occurs during the execution of a tool, the LLM model will carefully examine each generated argument and attempt to fix the problem."
