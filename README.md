# Local-LLM-Cookbook
Local LLM Cookbook is a collection of examples and best practices for enhancing the usability and robustness of local Large Language Models (LLMs). Provide practical examples, optimization tips, and tutorials to make LLMs reliable.

# LangChain cookbook

Example code for building applications with Langgraph, focusing on practical and local LLM use cases.

Notebook | Description
:- | :-
[llm_chessmaster.ipynb](https://github.com/r95222023/Local-LLM-Cookbook/tree/main/Langgraph/llm_chessmaster.ipynb) | Build a chess application that is designed to provide an interactive chess-playing experience with a large language model(LLM).
[robust_react_agent.ipynb](https://github.com/r95222023/Local-LLM-Cookbook/tree/main/Langgraph/robust_react_agent.ipynb) | Perform retrieval-augmented generation (rag) on documents with semi-structured data, including text and tables, using unstructured for parsing, multi-vector retriever for storing, and lcel for implementing chains.
[code_assistant.ipynb](https://github.com/r95222023/Local-LLM-Cookbook/tree/main/Langgraph/code_assistant.ipynb) | Build a code assistant that generates boilerplate code, templates, or even entire functions/classes based on high-level descriptions.
[llm_function_call.ipynb](https://github.com/r95222023/Local-LLM-Cookbook/tree/main/Langgraph/llm_function_call.ipynb) | Build an agent that is designed for robust tool-calling functionality. If an error occurs during the execution of a tool, the LLM model will be asked to carefully examine each generated argument and attempt to fix the problem.
[llm_structured_output.ipynb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/cookbook/llm_structured_output.ipynb) | Build an robust agent with structured outputs. If an error occurs during the execution of a tool, the LLM model will be asked to carefully examine each generated argument and attempt to fix the problem.
